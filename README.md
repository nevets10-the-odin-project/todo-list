## Introduction

At this point you’ve already had a fair amount of practice using the various techniques we’ve shown you. But we’ve been throwing a lot of information your way, so before we move on we’re going to take a minute to slow down and work on another great project that ties these techniques together. You should have the chance to show off most (if not all) of your newfound skills!
The todo list

Todo lists are a staple in beginning webdev tutorials, the implementation can be basic. There is, however, a lot of room for improvement and many features that can be added.

Before diving into the code, take a minute to think about how you are going to want to organize your project.

## Outline
Todo items need:
- Title
- Description
- Due Date
- Priority
- Notes (Optional)
